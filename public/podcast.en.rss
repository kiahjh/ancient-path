We transgress the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, the law of living faith, and so experience little of the blessings and benefits that are only found in the covenant.]]></itunes:subtitle>

Paul says, “I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the POWER of God.” What do you really know about the “effectual working” of this powerful gospel? Has the gospel changed your heart, cleansed your soul, given you a new Spirit, with new desires, new understanding, and a new will? Is it restoring in you the image and likeness of God that man lost in the beginning?]]></itunes:subtitle>

          <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It's one thing to know that Christ is the Word of God, it's another thing to experience the implanted Word of God (that is to say, the living communication and manifestation of God) actually putting off from us everything in our heart, mind, and thoughts that is contrary to Him, and clothing us with an entirely new nature. Christians often fall very short here, satisfying themselves by confessing and professing what they do not really possess. ]]></itunes:subtitle>

          <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Christ comes to transform you, not to inform you. Many people adore His words, but hate His nature when it appears (little by little) as a judge and teacher in their hearts. They love what He said, but they crucify who He IS when His light demands a conformity to His image. And when we won't love, follow and submit to His light, then it moves on without us, always heading to the Promised Land, and we are left behind, doing circles in the wilderness, arguing about His words.]]></itunes:subtitle>

          <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Here is your condition. This is what you currently feel, and what everyone can feel if they are willing to turn to the Voice that reproves them. You feel something stirring and moving in you that is good, and pure, and living, and is excited to know and really find and follow Christ. And yet you feel something else in you that is very different, very contrary, big, and well-fed. What are these two things? And why are they wrestling within you?]]></itunes:subtitle>

          <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[There is a great difference between a diligence or striving to carefully submit to and cooperate with the work of God, and a striving to produce a work of our own. The effort involved on our part is never to produce life, light, righteousness, or spiritual growth, but rather to diligently submit to that which comes from God and works by His power, and to carefully live in such a way that our lives in the body, and our time in this world, do not wage war against His purpose for our souls.]]></itunes:subtitle>
